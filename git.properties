## Track the current changes being made to the project here
## and use these properties in a Gradle task to streamline commits

# Example:
# ant.loadproperties srcfile: "git.properties"
# println ant.getProperty("commit-title") + "\n\n" + ant.getProperty("commit-summary")

commit-title=Repackage the project
commit-summary=Organizes the buildSrc code into packages and supplies test coverage (a breaking change for projects using the old structure). Attempts to implement a slightly better DSL for some tasks. Adds some annotations to help with testing and documenting the source.
